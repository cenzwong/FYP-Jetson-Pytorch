# Pytorch Transfer Learning

## Nvidia provided tools
"./dataset.py", "./dataset_class.py", "./utils.py" is developed by Nvidia such that it provide some APi to communicate with the down level. All Jupyter notebook has import this module and this must be put with the Jupyter notebook.

## Interface for  Transfer Learning

"demo0604_classification_interactive.ipynb", "demo0604_regression_interactive.ipynb" are two notebook that provide the interface for performing transfer learning.
