Headless mode, unsuccessful with opening the juptyer notebook on http://192.168.55.1:8888/. but able to access it though ssh(22),
Reflash the image again and skip the booting with monitor and directly using USB device mode.

The image inside the Deep Learning Course is different with the Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card Image. [NVIDIA DLI Jetson Nano SD Card Image](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/training/nano/dlinano_v1-0-0_image_20GB.zip) ==> dlinano_v1-0-0_image_20GB.zip

After flashing the new image onto Jetson Nano, open 192.168.55.1:8888, and password "dlinano". And successfully log in.

## 23102019 Flashing the Nano with the following image 
+ my [Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card Image](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#intro) ==> jetson-nano-sd-r32.2.1.zip

Program used to flash image: Etcher-Portable-1.4.6-x64.exe

I have boot it with monitor and USB and mouse, it can successfully boot up.
